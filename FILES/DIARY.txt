>>FIRST ENTRY
Well, this is the first entry here. So i'll explain what the IRL diary is about.
The IRL diary is about the plans from COS v2.7 onwards and techniques, ideas, schematics, blah blah blah...
Its helps me not forget things. Like remember algorithms, and diagrams.
It's also used to plan what tasks are left to do. Set deadlines and other targets.
Every TCOS member has access to the Developer Diary.
Its just one awesome piece of work. Organised work.
