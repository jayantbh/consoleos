ConsoleOS (COSOEPC : ConsoleOS Operating Environment Program Concept) is a startup concept for a different kind of OS.
One without the kind of kernel, interface, structure and mechanism that's been around for so long.
This idea was started in November 2011 by only one guy. The same guy who is typing this.
Later in April 2012, Another guy, Susobhan Ghosh joined him by helping ut primarily with the calculator.
Again, later in about July, another guy Biswajeet Kr. Paul joined up with Susobhan to work on the calculator.
In August, our class teacher Mr. Abhisek Roy tell us that we have a project to submit.
Instantly the idea of a Graphicised ConsoleOS jumps up in the typists mind and so it begins.
Over a span of 4 months, it turned from a simple "ConsoleOS" on the bootscreen to a full fleged OEPC.
Now it's going on with the hope of being a legendary OS sometime soon.
