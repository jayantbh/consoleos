BLOOPERS!
It actually means the silly and massive mistake we made on the way to ConsoleOS!

The Best one first...

>>SEGMENT COS_FIX_TEXT EXCEEDS 64K
This one actually freaked us like hell, cuz we know we can't increase the quota assigned.
After two days, Susobhan came out with the solution.
Define all the crap out of the classes!
Our lovely Bookworm. :)

>>UNABLE TO OPEN XYZ.OBJ
We had no clue what the hell this was! We get it every now and then.
TO fix it, we just copy the code to a new .cpp and compile!

>>UNABLE TO USE TLINK.EXE
Damn! WE ALWAYS get this error even now on every damn x64 PC!
