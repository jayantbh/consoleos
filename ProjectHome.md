# The ConsoleOS Operating Environment Concept Program #

The most ambitious project undertaken by a class 11th student back in November 2011, started under the name MOAP, then CZOS and so on... **This little Console Based application isn't actually an _Operating System_ but a start to a dream**. A serious dream. Of building the most user-friendly and efficient Operating System in existence, **from scratch**. The Project initially started alone by **Jayant Bhawal**(me|Developer and Analyst), and after 10 months joined officially by _Susobhan Ghosh_(Developer and Analyst), _Biswajit Kumar Paul_(Developer and Secondary designer) and _Sandhitsa Ghosh_(Designer), but wait, there's more, Soumajeet Basu(pretty much Comedian). The project which taught me so much... About not just C++ but much more... Will eventually grow up to be a full scale bootable version for touch based devices. Currently it left some advantages of 32-bit console environment for a 16-bit graphical environment. The animations, visuals and possiblities are amazing even with just 16 colors! Believe it.

Since the second milestone complete, there's a next version to come.
